## History and more
> Writing computer programs involves manipulating finite memory and I/O data devices through instructions executed by the CPU.

Our program deals with memory manipulation everytime.
* Memory Hierarchy

The CPU does not only interacts with RAM but also with other storage devices managed by the computational system.

> Everything (or almost) is memory. (data or instructions)

The OS abstract a program's location in the memory hierarchy, freeing it from needing to know the physical implementation.

### CPU Clock
> To execute an instruction the CPU needs at least one clock cicle.

The decision about how many clock cycles an instruction takes is determined during CPU design.

| **Reminder**

**CPU timeline**

Search instruction in memory > decode > execute > storage output in memory
